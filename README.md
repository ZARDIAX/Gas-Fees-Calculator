Hey there! Jesus here (Jess for buddies lmao), I'm getting in Python 10 days ago and I feel pretty anxious. When you're coming from other field (sports betting) and you're trying to learn new stuffs at the beginning this could be like sack shock, or like drop you to the sea without know how to swimg (tha's my current mood).

I'd like to share y'all my small code that I wrote these days, I know Isn't the best thing but is the first roman empire rock. 
Essentially is a fees calculator for real estate brokers, in Mexico the fees per houses selling are around 1-3%, in this case 3% (cause we're charitable persons). 

Perhaps you'll ask me "why a gas fee calculator?", well, last year I worked as broker in a real estate sing in Merida Yucatan, so tha's one of the industries where I still keep in learning and it's also interesing how make money there.

Whatever, this new tech knowledge bombing is killing me, I'll take a breath and then I'll keeping updating y'all, promise üíù.
